# Benchmark RAG
Author: Tiernan Lindauer, Datastax Inc.

## Introduction
This repository tests AstraDB's ColBERT vector search implementation compared to Pinecone and Weaviate's Hybrid Search implementations. It tests latency, cost, and relevancy.

The main file is `benchmark.py` which runs the tests. You'll need to have Jupiter Notebook installed to run the tests.

This repository and evaluation is open-source, and does not contain any proprietary information.
